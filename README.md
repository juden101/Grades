# Python Grading Program Assessment

This repository contains a starter code for a Python programming assessment. The goal of this assessment is to write a program that determines a grade based on a given score.

## Task

Write a Python program that prompts the user for a score between `0.0` and `1.0`. Based on the input score, the program should print a corresponding grade according to the following criteria:

| Score Range  | Grade |
| ------------ | ----- |
| >= 0.9       | A     |
| >= 0.8       | B     |
| >= 0.7       | C     |
| >= 0.6       | D     |
| < 0.6        | F     |

If the user enters a score outside the range `0.0` to `1.0`, the program should print an error message and exit.

### Example

For a score of `0.85`, the program should output:
